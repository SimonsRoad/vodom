# vodom - Monocular Visual Odometry

The goal of this mini-project is to implement a simple, monocular, visual 
odometry (VO) pipeline with the most essential features: initialization of
3D landmarks, keypoint tracking between two frames, pose estimation using 
established 2D ? 3D correspondences, and triangulation of new land- marks.
